"""
In an undirected graph, the degree d(u) of a vertex u is the number of neighbors u has,
    or equivalently, the number of edges incident upon it.

Given: A simple graph with nâ‰¤10^3 vertices in the edge list format.

Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the degree of vertex i.

Example:

Input:
    6 7 # n and m, number of vertices and edges
    1 2
    2 3
    6 3
    5 6
    2 5
    2 4
    4 1

Return:
    2 4 2 2 2 2
