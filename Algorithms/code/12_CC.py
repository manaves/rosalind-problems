The task is to use depth-first search to compute the number of connected components in a given undirected graph.

Given: A simple graph with nâ‰¤10^3 vertices in the edge list format.

Return: The number of connected components in the graph.

Example:
    Input:
    12 13
    1 2
    1 5
    5 9
    5 10
    9 10
    3 4
    3 7
    3 8
    4 8
    7 11
    8 11
    11 12
    8 12
    
    Output:
